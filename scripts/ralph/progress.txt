## Session Log

## 2025-01-16 - US-000
- Copied multitenancy starter (backend + frontend) from Applets/Mutltitenantandauthentication
- Preserved scripts/ralph/, SPEC.md, README.md
- Package names already set to ai-project-manager-backend and ai-project-manager-frontend
- Initialized git repository
- Created initial commit with 134 files
- **Files changed:** backend/*, frontend/*, .gitignore
- **Learnings:**
  - Windows copy commands have issues with bash cp - use PowerShell Copy-Item for reliability
  - Nested copy can happen with Copy-Item -Recurse - verify structure after copy
  - node_modules were copied but will need reinstall after .env setup

## 2026-01-16 - US-001
- Added Project model to Prisma schema with all required fields (UUID id, organizationId, name, client, description, startDate, targetEndDate, status, statusConfig JSON, isActive)
- Added unique constraint on (organizationId, name)
- Created backend/src/modules/projects/ with:
  - projects.schema.ts - Zod validation schemas
  - projects.service.ts - Business logic with CRUD operations
  - projects.controller.ts - HTTP handlers
  - projects.routes.ts - Express route definitions
- Registered routes in app.ts at /api/projects
- All endpoints tested and working:
  - GET /api/projects - list org projects
  - GET /api/projects/:id - get single project
  - POST /api/projects - create project
  - PUT /api/projects/:id - update project
  - DELETE /api/projects/:id - soft delete
- **Files changed:**
  - backend/prisma/schema.prisma
  - backend/prisma/migrations/20260116230950_add_project_model/
  - backend/src/modules/projects/* (new)
  - backend/src/app.ts
  - backend/tsconfig.json
- **Learnings:**
  - JSON fields in Prisma need explicit cast to Prisma.InputJsonValue when assigning
  - tsconfig.json had seed.ts included but outside rootDir - removed to fix type check errors
  - Pre-existing TypeScript errors in starter code (Express Request generic typing) - runtime works fine
  - Always use findFirst with organizationId check for multi-tenancy isolation
